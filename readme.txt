4. Initiate and use the plugin in your code by writing :

	4.1. $mode = 'utf-8'; 
	4.2. $size = array(212.72500, 276.22500);
	4.3. $html = '<div>';
	4.4. $footer = '<div>footer</div>';
	4.5. pdf_generation($mode, $size, $html, $footer); =
	
You have to run this (without the 4.1. etc.) to generate the PDF. Make sure you include the function pdf_generation.
Your $html is the variable where you store the content of the PDF, it's now, as an example, '<div>', you need to change that and add your own content. Same goes for the $footer.
